In the context of the PersonalizationEngine class, if it becomes necessary to divide the code into parts, one way could be breaking it down into smaller components. For example, we can have separate classes/ functions to generate the prompt, model loading, email generation, etc. Here is an example of how it can be done:

```python
import openai
from src.utils import load_chat_model


class ChatModelLoader:
    @staticmethod
    def load_model():
        return load_chat_model()


class EmailGenerator:
    @staticmethod
    def _prepare_prompt(user_email, follow_up_content, previous_emails):
        """
        Prepare the prompt for the chat model.
        """
        # Start with the user's email and the follow-up content
        prompt = f"From: {user_email}\n\n{follow_up_content}\n\n"

        # Add the previous emails
        for email in previous_emails:
            prompt += f"-----\n\nFrom: {email['from']}\n\n{email['content']}\n\n"

        return prompt

    def generate_follow_up(self, chat_model, user_email, follow_up_content, previous_emails):
        """
        Generate a personalized follow-up email using ChatGPT.
        """
        # Prepare the prompt for the chat model
        prompt = self._prepare_prompt(user_email, follow_up_content, previous_emails)

        # Generate the follow-up email
        response = chat_model(prompt)

        return response


class PersonalizationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_loader = ChatModelLoader()
        self.email_generator = EmailGenerator()
        self.chat_model = self.model_loader.load_model()

    def generate_follow_up_email(self, user_email, follow_up_content, previous_emails):
        return self.email_generator.generate_follow_up(self.chat_model, user_email, follow_up_content, previous_emails)
```

This way, we have componentized the logic into separate entities working in concert, making it easier to manage, debug and extend in the future. We can even move these classes into separate files if they get bigger. The `PersonalizationEngine` now acts as an orchestrator that coordinates between these entities.
