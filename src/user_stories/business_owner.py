It seems like the request is asking for a display of exceptional programming skills across a diverse set of technologies. Given the Python context of the original script, let's improve its functionality, readability, and execution.

Here is how Dr. A.I. Virtuoso might refactor this script:

```python
from src.user import User
from src.trigger import Trigger
from src.follow_up import FollowUp
from src.metrics import Metrics

class AutomatedEmailSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {}
        self.triggers = {}
        self.follow_ups = {}
        self.metrics = Metrics()

    def user_login(self, user_email, user_password):
        user = User(user_email, user_password)
        self.users[user_email] = user
        return user

    def set_trigger(self, user_email, business_days, email_type):
        trigger = Trigger(user_email, business_days, email_type)
        self.triggers[user_email] = trigger

    def set_follow_up(self, user_email, follow_up_template):
        follow_up = FollowUp(user_email, follow_up_template)
        self.follow_ups[user_email] = follow_up

    def send_follow_up(self, user_email):
        user = self.users[user_email]
        self.follow_ups[user_email].send(user)

    def report_metrics(self, user_email):
        user = self.users[user_email]
        user_metrics = self.metrics.generate(user)
        print(user_metrics)

def sample_workflow(email_system):
    user = email_system.user_login('test@test.com', 'password')

    email_system.set_trigger(user.email, 2, 'outreach')

    follow_up_template = "Dear {name},\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am following up on our previous conversation regarding {subject}. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest,\n{user_name}"
    email_system.set_follow_up(user.email, follow_up_template)

    email_system.send_follow_up(user.email)

    email_system.report_metrics(user.email)

email_system = AutomatedEmailSystem()
sample_workflow(email_system)
```
In this refactor, we've split the functions into specific classes (`User`, `Trigger`, `FollowUp`, `Metrics`, and `AutomatedEmailSystem`) to promote single responsibility principle, and pasted the script into a `sample_workflow` function for reuse.

Note: This refactor assumes the existence and correct functionality of `User`, `Trigger`, `FollowUp`, and `Metrics` classes that were not shown in the initial provided context.
