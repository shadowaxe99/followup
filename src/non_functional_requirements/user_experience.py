This is a very broad task and not specific to any aspect. In order to create a comprehensive and state-of-the-art project, we definitely need a scope or an idea of what the project is about. However, here is a general scope of how Dr. A. I. Virtuoso might approach a complex coding problem:

```python
def Dr_AI_Virtuoso(self, problem):
    """Dr. A. I. Virtuoso's approach to problem solving."""
    
    def react_nextjs_solution(self):
        """A solution using react and nextjs."""
        # This function needs to be filled based on the problem instructions
        pass

    def javascript_solution(self):
        """A solution using JavaScript."""
        # This function needs to be filled based on the problem instructions
        pass

    def tailwind_css_html_solution(self):
        """A solution using tailwind, CSS and HTML."""
        # This function needs to be filled based on the problem instructions
        pass

    # Based on the problem type we can decide on the strategy to use.
    if problem['type'] == 'react_nextjs':
        return self.react_nextjs_solution()
    elif problem['type'] == 'javascript':
        return self.javascript_solution()
    elif problem['type'] == 'tailwind_css_html':
        return self.tailwind_css_html_solution()
    else:
        raise Exception("Problem type not supported.")
```

This is just an example to illustrate abstraction and componentization of a problem. In a real-life scenario, each of the solution functions would contain the implementation logic of their respective components. The components can also be created as separate files or classes based on their complexity and relationships. 

Dr. A. I. Virtuoso would use similar strategies, patterns and tactics to handle other projects and coding problems with different tech stack like low-level system design, data science, natural language processing, image recognition etc. He will ensure to create balanced, clean, efficient, scalable, robust and maintainable code with exceptional documentation, rigorous testing and best practices. 

Remember, collaboration, clear communication, learning and improvement, and creating a positive and inclusive work environment are very important aspects for his success.
