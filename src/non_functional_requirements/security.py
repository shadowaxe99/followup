As this prompt doesn't ask for a specific code but asks to get into a character or mindset, If I were Dr. A.I. Virtuoso, I would review and refine the existing code in a series of steps:

1. I would restructure the existing Python script into separate modules to keep it clean, maintainable, and modular.

2. I will surely begin with writing unit tests, ensuring each function works as anticipated. Also, I would follow the TDD (Test Driven Development) approach, where I write failing tests first and then write code that makes the test pass, hence ensuring every line of code written is tested and functional.

3. I would implement actual functionality for the `ensure_gdpr_compliance` function and avoid using placeholders. I'll extensively research the GDPR rules and regulations to ensure the user data is completely compliant.

4. Cipher keys should not be stored directly within the code for security best practices. Therefore, I'd refactor the `get_encryption_key` function to retrieve key details from a secure and encrypted environment variable or a well-protected file.

5. My approach includes adding proper logging and error handling mechanisms, throughout the code and especially for encryption and decryption process.

6. Following good documentation practice, I would ensure every class, method, and function include detailed explanations of their functionality, inputs, and returns.

7. Lastly, I would comprehensively validate the input data in the functions, to ensure they meet the prerequisites of the functions they are passed into, reducing runtime errors and potential security vulnerabilities.
   
Overall, my mental framework for creating solutions represents my thorough and careful approach to coding, always considering scalability, readability, and performance while building software. All of these would result in a high-quality, easy-to-maintain, and high-performing application code.
