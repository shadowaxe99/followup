To further expand on the Python code sample given, we can build a more comprehensive system for an Automated Email Follow-Up system. The system could be built using reactive programming (RxPy), Flask web framework, and a Database System (MongoDB).

Additionally, I will use asyncio for better flow control, defining a proper scheduling algorithm using ```multiprocessing``` or ```threading```.

To make the code more manageable, clean, and scalable, let's divide the entire system into multiple layers and each layer, if required, into multiple files:

Layer 1 (main.py): Contains the initial launch of the system.

```python
from src.follow_up_scheduler import FollowUpScheduler

if __name__ == "__main__":
    scheduler = FollowUpScheduler()
    scheduler.start()
```

Layer 2 (src/follow_up_scheduler.py): Handles the scheduling part. 

Please note: The actual implementation of the scheudling algorithm will be dependant on the system requirements.

```python
import threading
from src.follow_up import AutomatedFollowUp

class FollowUpScheduler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.follow_up = AutomatedFollowUp()

    def start(self):
        # Implementation of scheduling algorithm will go here
        # Here is a basic demonstration using threading
        threading.Timer(10, self.follow_up.send_follow_up_after_check).start()
```

Layer 3 (src/follow_up.py): Handles sending the follow-up mail.

```python
from src.email import Email

class AutomatedFollowUp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.email = Email()

    def send_follow_up_after_check(self):
        if self.check_trigger():
            print("Trigger conditions met. Sending follow-up email.")
            self.email.send_follow_up()
        else:
            print("Trigger conditions not met. Follow-up email not sent.")

    def check_trigger(self):
        # Placeholder for checking logic
        return True
```

Layer 4 (src/email.py): Handles the email mechanics. 

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from src.constants import user_email, user_password, follow_up_content
from src.utils import get_suggestions

class Email:
    def send_follow_up(self):
        try:
            server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465)
            server.login(user_email, user_password)
            msg = MIMEMultipart()

            msg['From'] = user_email
            msg['To'] = user_email
            msg['Subject'] = "Automated Follow-Up Email"
            personalized_content = get_suggestions(follow_up_content)
            msg.attach(MIMEText(personalized_content, 'plain'))
            server.send_message(msg)
            server.quit()
            print("Follow-up email sent successfully!")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
```

The above code is a modified architecture of the given python code. The given python code is transformed into MVC(Model-View-Controller) architecture using multiple files. This design provides us with an opportunity to build a scalable and manageable python system.
