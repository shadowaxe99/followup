This is an unusual request as it does not ask for a specific code or solution. However, to demonstrate the capabilities of "Dr. A. I. Virtuoso", here is an example of how he might approach a problem. Based on the config file provided, let's assume that a task at hand is to implement the automatic email follow-up system. Here is how this might be approached:

1. Set up connection with the Gmail API using the given credentials to be able to send emails.
2. Schedule follow-up emails based on the TRIGGER_CONDITIONS specified, this could be done by creating a background worker to check the conditions periodically.
3. Compute performance metrics based provided open_rate and click_through_rate.
4. Update the Dashboard DOM Element with the latest metrics.
5. Create an event listener that notifies the user whenever there's a status update using the configured MESSAGE_NAMES.

Here's a general structure of the solution. Note: This is a highly simplified version and far from a fully-featured solution: 

```python
# Import required libraries
import time
import requests
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials

# Import config
from config import GMAIL_API_CREDENTIALS, TRIGGER_CONDITIONS
from config import PERFORMANCE_METRICS, DOM_ELEMENT_IDS, MESSAGE_NAMES
from config import DATABASE_CONFIG

# Presumed modules - these would be implemented separately
from gmail_api import GmailAPI
from dashboard import Dashboard
from scheduler import Scheduler
from database import Database

class FollowUpSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gmail = GmailAPI(GMAIL_API_CREDENTIALS)
        self.dashboard = Dashboard(DOM_ELEMENT_IDS, MESSAGE_NAMES)
        self.db = Database(DATABASE_CONFIG)
        self.scheduler = Scheduler()

    def start(self):
        # Freshly retrieve the trigger_conditions and user_profiles from the database
        trigger_conditions = self.db.get_conditions(TRIGGER_CONDITIONS)
        user_profiles = self.db.get_user_profiles()

        for profile in user_profiles:
            # Get relevant condition for the user_profile
            condition = trigger_conditions.get(profile.type)

            if condition:
                # Calculate follow_up_time
                follow_up_time = profile.get_message_time() + condition['days_after'] * 24 * 60 * 60

                # Schedule the sending of follow_up_email
                self.scheduler.schedule(self.gmail.send_follow_up_email, follow_up_time, [profile])

        self.scheduler.start()

follow_up_system = FollowUpSystem()
follow_up_system.start()
```
Key components of the solution:

- GmailAPI: A class that handles communication with Gmail, using the Google's gmail API.
- Dashboard: A class that is in charge of UI and interaction with the user depending on the state of the system.
- Scheduler: A class that serves to schedule tasks (email sending), it's similar to a cron job.
- Database: A class that manages interaction with the database, using the psycopg2 library. 

This solution is modular, scalable, and efficient, yet maintaining simplicity and readability of code which makes it manageable and maintainable. Each component is responsible for its own domain, which allows us to replace, change, or update the individual modules without affecting the system as a whole. This is a divide and conquer approach to meet industry standard design principles.
